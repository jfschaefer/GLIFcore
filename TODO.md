# TODO

Various non-researchy things that need to be done.

* The design of `Item`/`Items` as well as `Result` is problematic.
    One key issue is having multiple places for error messages,
    but in general a cleaner, more pythonic design would be better.
* Switch to `pyproject.toml`?
* Show the GLIF core version in the `status` command.
* Add a `display-file` command (move pygments highlighters here).
